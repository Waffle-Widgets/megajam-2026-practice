### 2026-11-01 — Signed up
- Entered the 2026 Epic AI MegaJam as a two-person team with almost no game dev experience.
- Made a plan, picked tools (Unreal 5.8, Claude Code, Gemini), and set up a practice repo to get everything working before the jam.

### 2026-11-01 — Setting up the second PC (Gaming PC 1)
- **What we tried:** Getting this PC ready to drive the project: clone the repo, install the tools, open the Unreal project made on the other PC.
- **Prompt(s) we gave the agent:** "I need that repo here so we can send remote commands to it." / "Can you get what is needed set up on this machine?" / "UE is installed now we need to open the project that was created on another computer for this repo."
- **What happened:**
  - Claude found the repo in our GitHub org and cloned it, then checked what was installed. Git, Git LFS, Node, Claude Code and the Epic Launcher were already there.
  - It installed Gemini CLI, GitHub Desktop and Visual Studio 2022 with the C++ game workload, and turned on Git LFS. Unreal 5.8 we installed ourselves, because it needs an Epic login.
  - The project's `.uproject` was tied to an engine ID that only existed on the other PC, so this PC would have asked which engine to use. Claude opened it straight in the 5.8 editor, then changed the file to say `5.8` so it opens on both PCs.
  - The Unreal MCP server auto-started when the editor opened, thanks to the setting committed from the other PC.
  - The first commit failed because Git on the new PC didn't know who we were. We had to set a name and email first.
  - Claude Code can't use a newly added MCP server in the session it's already in. It needs a new session and an approval.
- **What we learned:**
  - Setting up a second machine shows "works on my machine" problems early, like the engine ID and the missing Git identity.
  - Some installs need us at the keyboard: Epic login, permission prompts, sign-ins. Everything else the agent can do.
  - We read the jam rules: no building the game before Nov 12, and anything made before then gets declared (see `docs/RULES.md`).
- **Media:** (none yet)
