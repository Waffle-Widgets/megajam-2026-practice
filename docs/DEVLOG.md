### 2026-11-01 — Signed up
- Entered the 2026 Epic AI MegaJam as a two-person team with almost no game dev experience.
- Made a plan, picked tools (Unreal 5.8, Claude Code, Gemini), and set up a practice repo to get everything working before the jam.

### 2026-11-01 — Setting up the second PC (Gaming PC 1)
- **What we tried:** Getting this PC ready to drive the project: clone the repo, install the tools, open the Unreal project made on the other PC.
- **Prompt(s) we gave the agent:** "I need that repo here so we can send remote commands to it." / "Can you get what is needed set up on this machine?" / "UE is installed now we need to open the project that was created on another computer for this repo."
- **What happened:**
  - Claude found the repo in our GitHub org and cloned it, then checked what was installed. Git, Git LFS, Node, Claude Code and the Epic Launcher were already there.
  - It installed Gemini CLI, GitHub Desktop and Visual Studio 2022 with the C++ game workload, and turned on Git LFS. Unreal 5.8 we installed ourselves, because it needs an Epic login.
  - The project's `.uproject` was tied to an engine ID that only existed on the other PC, so this PC would have asked which engine to use. Claude opened it straight in the 5.8 editor, then changed the file to say `5.8` so it opens on both PCs.
  - The Unreal MCP server auto-started when the editor opened, thanks to the setting committed from the other PC.
  - The first commit failed because Git on the new PC didn't know who we were. We had to set a name and email first.
  - Claude Code can't use a newly added MCP server in the session it's already in. It needs a new session and an approval.
- **What we learned:**
  - Setting up a second machine shows "works on my machine" problems early, like the engine ID and the missing Git identity.
  - Some installs need us at the keyboard: Epic login, permission prompts, sign-ins. Everything else the agent can do.
  - We read the jam rules: no building the game before Nov 12, and anything made before then gets declared (see `docs/RULES.md`).
- **Media:** (none yet)

### 2026-11-01 — Checking the setup, and picking practice game 1
- **What we tried:** Making sure everything the agent needs works, then choosing what to build for practice round 1.
- **Prompt(s) we gave the agent:** "Check to see if everything you need is enabled to start working on this UE project." / "Let's do the pitch"
- **What happened:**
  - Claude connected to the editor over MCP, read the level and took an editor screenshot through it. Git, LFS, GitHub sign-in, Visual Studio and Node all checked out.
  - It noticed the project is Blueprint-only (no C++ source folder), which is fine for us.
  - It offered four tiny arcade games. We picked Frogger, since it fits the Third Person template. It drafted `docs/PITCH.md` with a cut list and we approved it.
- **What we learned:** Asking the agent to verify the setup with a real call (a screenshot) beats trusting the checklist.
- **Media:** (none)

### 2026-11-01 — One tile per hop
- **What we tried:** The core mechanic: each key press hops the character exactly one tile.
- **Prompt(s) we gave the agent:** "Yes, plan the hop" / "Go" / "Something's off" / "The model is not a frog. the person now hops but if you hold the button down it allows you to move very very slowly."
- **What happened:**
  - Claude planned first: a child Blueprint `BP_Frog` of the template character, a `BP_FroggerGameMode`, and a test level `Lvl_Frogger`. We said go.
  - Its Blueprint-writing tool couldn't attach code to the move input event, so it put the hop in a `TryHop` function and wired the input to it by hand. It also couldn't make a Timeline, so the hop arc runs on Event Tick.
  - Claude couldn't press keys inside Play mode itself, so we tested.
  - Bug 1: holding a key hopped once, then walked. The template's walking still ran alongside our hop.
  - First fix (walk speed 0) only half worked: the character still crept slowly. The template has a minimum walk speed.
  - Real fix: `BP_Frog` overrides the template's `Move` with an empty event, so walking is off at the source. That worked.
  - The model is still the mannequin. That's on purpose (it's on the pitch's cut list for now).
- **What we learned:** A child Blueprint doesn't replace the parent's input handling. Patching a symptom (speed 0) can hide the real cause. We're the testers for anything about feel.

### 2026-11-01 — Fixed Frogger camera, and the silent save
- **What we tried:** Lock the camera behind and above the frog, like the arcade game, with mouse look off.
- **Prompt(s) we gave the agent:** "Fixed camera"
- **What happened:**
  - Claude set up the camera arm on game start: fixed 55° angle, 10 m back, a little lag so it glides after each hop. The settings are tunable in the frog's Details panel.
  - The save reported success but nothing changed on disk. The cause: our Git LFS setup makes committed Unreal files read-only until someone locks them. Claude ran `git lfs lock` on `BP_Frog`, saved, committed, then unlocked.
- **What we learned:** Lock an asset before editing it. Always check the file actually changed after saving. We added these lessons to CLAUDE.md.

### 2026-11-01 — A frog that looks like a frog (sort of)
- **What we tried:** Swap the mannequin for a placeholder frog that fits our "chunky, toy-like" art style.
- **Prompt(s) we gave the agent:** "Yes, placeholder frog"
- **What happened:**
  - Claude locked `BP_Frog` first (the lesson from last time), then built a frog out of 10 basic shapes: body, head, two eyes with pupils, and four legs.
  - It made 4 color materials (`MI_FrogGreen`, `MI_FrogDarkGreen`, `MI_FrogEyeWhite`, `MI_FrogPupil`) from Unreal's basic shape material, just changing the color.
  - It turned collision off on all the shapes so the hop still only uses the invisible capsule, and hid the mannequin instead of deleting it.
  - The first Play-mode screenshot came out black because it was taken before the first frame was drawn. Taking it again worked.
- **What we learned:** Placeholder art from basic shapes is fast and good enough to judge size and feel. Hiding the old mesh is safer than deleting it when template code still uses it.
